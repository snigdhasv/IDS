## Conclusion

This IDS project has tremendous potential for growth and impact. The cleaned codebase provides a solid foundation for implementing these next steps. 

**Priority focus areas:**
1. üß™ Validate and test the current implementation
2. üìä Add visualization and monitoring
3. ü§ñ Enhance ML models with latest techniques
