## Todo List

- [x] Phase 1: Research and analyze DPDK architecture and packet generation requirements
  - [x] Synthesize research findings into a comprehensive report.
- [x] Phase 2: Design and implement Python-based packet generator with benign and malicious packet patterns
  - [x] Research Python libraries for packet generation (e.g., Scapy).
  - [x] Implement Python code for benign packet generation.
  - [x] Implement Python code for malicious packet generation.
- [x] Phase 3: Outline conceptual Python interaction with DPDK applications
  - [x] Document conceptual Python interaction with DPDK applications (subprocess, Scapy for PCAP generation).
- [ ] Phase 4: Package and deliver the complete pipeline implementation (Python-focused)
