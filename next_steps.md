## Conclusion

This IDS project has tremendous potential for growth and impact. The cleaned codebase provides a solid foundation for implementing these next steps.

**Priority focus areas:**

1. üß™ Validate and test the current implementation
2. üìä Add visualization and monitoring
3. ü§ñ Enhance ML models with latest techniques
4. üåê Scale to production-grade deployment

The combination of traditional signature-based detection (Suricata) with machine learning creates a powerful hybrid approach that can detect both known and unknown threats.

**Let's build the future of network security! üöÄ**
