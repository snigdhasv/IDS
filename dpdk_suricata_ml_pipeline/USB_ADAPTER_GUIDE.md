# USB Network Adapter - DPDK Limitation & Solution

## üö® The Problem

Your network interface `enx00e04c36074c` is a **USB Ethernet adapter** (Realtek r8152 chipset).

**DPDK DOES NOT SUPPORT USB NETWORK DEVICES** because:
- DPDK requires direct PCI/PCIe memory access
- USB devices use a different I/O subsystem
- DPDK binding scripts expect PCI addresses like `0000:01:00.0`, not USB paths

### Your System Hardware
```
Available Interfaces:
- lo: Loopback (not usable)
- wlo1: Intel WiFi PCI device (not suitable for DPDK packet capture)
- enx00e04c36074c: USB Ethernet adapter (cannot use DPDK)
```

## ‚úÖ Solution: Use AF_PACKET Mode

**AF_PACKET** is Suricata's high-performance mode that works with **ANY** network interface, including USB adapters.

### Performance Comparison
| Mode | Speed | Hardware Required | USB Support |
|------|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| **DPDK** | Fastest (10-100 Gbps) | PCI/PCIe NIC | ‚ùå No |
| **AF_PACKET** | Fast (1-10 Gbps) | Any NIC | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **PCAP** | Slow (<1 Gbps) | Any NIC | ‚úÖ Yes |

For your use case (IDS with ML pipeline), **AF_PACKET is more than sufficient**.

## üöÄ Quick Start with AF_PACKET

### 1. Use the New AF_PACKET Script

```bash
cd ~/Programming/IDS/dpdk_suricata_ml_pipeline/scripts

# Start Suricata in AF_PACKET mode (no DPDK binding needed!)
sudo ./03_start_suricata_afpacket.sh
```

### 2. Complete Pipeline with AF_PACKET

```bash
# Step 1: Start Kafka (if not already running)
sudo ./02_setup_kafka.sh

# Step 2: Start Suricata in AF_PACKET mode
sudo ./03_start_suricata_afpacket.sh

# Step 3: Start ML consumer
./04_start_ml_consumer.sh

# Step 4: Replay traffic (in another terminal)
sudo ./05_replay_traffic.sh
```

### 3. Monitor

```bash
# Watch alerts in real-time
tail -f ../logs/suricata/eve.json | jq .

# Check Suricata stats
suricatasc -c dump-counters

# Check process
ps aux | grep suricata
```

## üìã Key Differences: DPDK vs AF_PACKET

### DPDK Mode (Original Scripts)
```bash
# Requires PCI/PCIe network card
sudo ./01_bind_interface.sh    # Binds interface to DPDK (FAILS with USB)
sudo ./03_start_suricata.sh    # Starts Suricata in DPDK mode
```

### AF_PACKET Mode (New Script)
```bash
# Works with ANY interface (USB, WiFi, PCI)
# No binding needed!
sudo ./03_start_suricata_afpacket.sh  # Just works!
```

---

## üîß Configuration

Your current config in `config/pipeline.conf` works for both modes:

```bash
# Network Interface Configuration
NETWORK_INTERFACE="enx00e04c36074c"  # USB adapter - works with AF_PACKET!

# Suricata Configuration
SURICATA_CORES="2"                    # Worker threads
SURICATA_HOME_NET="192.168.0.0/16"    # Your network
```

## üéØ When Do You NEED DPDK?

You need DPDK only if:
- ‚úÖ You have 10+ Gbps traffic loads
- ‚úÖ You have a physical PCI/PCIe network card (Intel i350, X520, X710, etc.)
- ‚úÖ You need <1¬µs latency packet processing

For your project (IDS with ML), **AF_PACKET is perfect**.

---

## üí° Alternative: Get a DPDK-Compatible NIC

If you want to use DPDK in the future, you need to buy a **PCI/PCIe Ethernet card**:

### Recommended Cards:
- **Intel i350** (~$50) - 1 Gbps, excellent DPDK support
- **Intel X520** (~$100) - 10 Gbps, very popular for DPDK
- **Intel X710** (~$200) - 10 Gbps, latest generation

### Check Compatibility:
- DPDK Supported NICs: https://core.dpdk.org/supported/

### Installation:
1. Install PCIe network card in desktop/server
2. Run `lspci | grep Ethernet` - should show device like `01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Intel...`
3. Update `NETWORK_INTERFACE` in config to the new interface
4. Then `01_bind_interface.sh` will work!

## üß™ Testing with AF_PACKET

### Test 1: Capture Live Traffic
```bash
sudo ./03_start_suricata_afpacket.sh

# In another terminal, generate some traffic
ping 8.8.8.8
curl https://google.com

# Check logs
tail -f ../logs/suricata/eve.json | jq .
```

### Test 2: Replay PCAP
```bash
# Start pipeline
sudo ./03_start_suricata_afpacket.sh
./04_start_ml_consumer.sh

# Replay attack traffic
sudo ./05_replay_traffic.sh
```

### Test 3: Full Demo
```bash
cd ~/Programming/IDS/tests
python quick_attack_demo.py
```

## üìä Expected Performance

### Your USB Adapter (AF_PACKET mode)
- **Throughput**: 100-500 Mbps sustained
- **Latency**: 10-50¬µs
- **Packet Rate**: ~100K packets/sec
- **CPU Usage**: 50-80% (2 cores)

This is **more than enough** for:
- ‚úÖ Development and testing
- ‚úÖ Small office network monitoring
- ‚úÖ ML model training and validation
- ‚úÖ Research projects

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue: Interface is DOWN
```bash
sudo ip link set enx00e04c36074c up
```

### Issue: Permission Denied
```bash
# AF_PACKET scripts need root for packet capture
sudo ./03_start_suricata_afpacket.sh
```

### Issue: No Traffic Captured
```bash
# Check interface has an IP and is connected
ip addr show enx00e04c36074c

# Generate test traffic
ping 8.8.8.8
```

### Issue: Suricata Won't Start
```bash
# Check logs
sudo tail -50 /var/log/suricata/suricata.log

# Check if port is in use
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep suricata
```
