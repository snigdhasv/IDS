# Flow-Based ML Inference Architecture

## Overview

This pipeline implements **comprehensive flow-based ML inference** that analyzes **ALL network traffic**, not just signature-based alerts. This provides superior threat detection by combining signature-based IDS with ML anomaly detection.

## Architecture Comparison

### Traditional Alert-Only Processing ❌
```
Packets → Suricata → [Alerts Only] → ML → Predictions
              ↓
         99% traffic ignored
```
**Problems:**
- Only analyzes ~1% of traffic (what triggers signatures)
- Zero-day attacks without signatures are invisible
- Anomalous "benign" traffic goes undetected
- Limited threat coverage

### Flow-Based Processing ✅ (This Pipeline)
```
Packets → Suricata → [ALL Flows + Alerts] → ML → Enhanced Alerts
                            ↓
                      100% coverage
```
**Benefits:**
- ✅ Every network flow analyzed by ML
- ✅ Detects zero-day attacks without signatures
- ✅ Identifies anomalous behavior in all traffic
- ✅ Comprehensive threat detection

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Suricata Flow Logging

**Configuration** (`03_start_suricata.sh`):
```yaml
outputs:
  - eve-log:
      filetype: kafka
      kafka:
        bootstrap-servers: localhost:9092
        topic: suricata-alerts
      types:
        - alert    # Signature-based alerts
        - flow     # ALL network flows ← KEY ADDITION
```

**What gets logged:**
- **Flow events**: Every TCP/UDP/ICMP connection
- **Alert events**: Suricata signature matches
- **HTTP/DNS/TLS**: Protocol-specific events (optional)

### 2. Feature Extraction (`feature_extractor.py`)

**CICIDS2017 Feature Set** (65 features):

| Category | Features | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Basic Flow | Duration, packet counts, byte counts | `Flow Duration`, `Total Fwd Packets` |
| Packet Lengths | Min, max, mean, std (fwd/bwd) | `Fwd Packet Length Mean` |
| Inter-Arrival Time | IAT stats (flow/fwd/bwd) | `Flow IAT Mean`, `Fwd IAT Std` |
| TCP Flags | FIN, SYN, RST, PSH, ACK, URG, ECE | `ACK Flag Count`, `Fwd PSH Flags` |
| Header Lengths | Forward & backward headers | `Fwd Header Length` |
| Rates | Packets/sec, bytes/sec | `Flow Bytes/s`, `Fwd Packets/s` |
| Packet Stats | Min, max, mean, std, variance | `Packet Length Mean` |
| Ratios | Down/up ratio, segment sizes | `Down/Up Ratio`, `Avg Fwd Segment Size` |
| Subflows | Forward & backward subflow bytes | `Subflow Fwd Bytes` |
| Window | TCP window sizes | `Init_Win_bytes_forward` |
| Data Packets | Active data packets | `act_data_pkt_fwd` |
| Active/Idle | Activity timing features | `Active Mean`, `Idle Max` |

**Feature Extraction Process:**
```python
# Extract from Suricata flow event
features = feature_extractor.extract_from_flow(flow_event)

# Returns dictionary with 65 features:
{
    'Destination Port': 53,
    'Flow Duration': 2500000,  # microseconds
    'Total Fwd Packets': 10,
    'Total Backward Packets': 10,
    'Flow Bytes/s': 5120.0,
    ...  # 60 more features
}
```

### 3. ML Inference (`model_loader.py`)

**Supported Models:**
- **Random Forest** (scikit-learn): Ensemble decision trees
- **LightGBM**: Gradient boosting framework

**Model Loading:**
```python
model_loader = MLModelLoader()
model_loader.load_model(model_name='random_forest_model_2017.joblib')

# Make prediction
prediction, confidence = model_loader.predict(feature_vector)
# Example: ('DoS', 0.9523)
```

**Attack Categories:**
- `BENIGN`: Normal traffic
- `DoS`: Denial of Service
- `DDoS`: Distributed Denial of Service
- `RECONNAISSANCE`: Port scanning, probing
- `BRUTE_FORCE`: Password cracking attempts
- `BOTNET`: Bot activity
- `WEB_ATTACK`: XSS, SQL injection, etc.
- `INFILTRATION`: Intrusion attempts

### 4. Alert Processing (`alert_processor.py`)

**Combined Threat Scoring:**
```
Threat Score = (Suricata Weight × Suricata Score) + (ML Weight × ML Confidence)
             = (0.6 × suricata_score) + (0.4 × ml_confidence)
```

**Threat Levels:**
| Score | Level | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 0.8+ | CRITICAL | Immediate response required |
| 0.6-0.8 | HIGH | Priority investigation |
| 0.4-0.6 | MEDIUM | Standard review |
| 0.2-0.4 | LOW | Log and monitor |
| <0.2 | BENIGN | No action |

**Enhanced Alert Format:**
```json
{
  "alert_id": "alert_20240115103045123456",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123456+0000",
  "event_type": "enhanced_alert",
  
  "flow": {
    "src_ip": "192.168.1.100",
    "src_port": 54321,
    "dest_ip": "8.8.8.8",
    "dest_port": 53,
    "proto": "UDP"
  },
  
  "detection": {
    "suricata": false,        // No signature match
    "ml": true,               // ML detected anomaly
    "method": "ml"
  },
  
  "ml": {
    "prediction": "DoS",
    "confidence": 0.9523,
    "attack_category": "DoS"
  },
  
  "threat": {
    "score": 0.3809,         // Combined score
    "level": "HIGH",
    "severity": 3
  },
  
  "flow_stats": {
    "pkts_toserver": 100,
    "pkts_toclient": 0,
    "bytes_toserver": 6400,
    "bytes_toclient": 0,
    "age": 5.5
  }
}
```

### 5. Flow Correlation (`ml_kafka_consumer.py`)

**Problem:** Suricata may send alert BEFORE flow event
**Solution:** Flow cache for correlation

```python
# When alert arrives first
flow_cache[flow_id] = {'alert': alert_event}

# When flow arrives later
if flow_id in flow_cache:
    suricata_alert = flow_cache[flow_id]['alert']
    # Combine ML + Suricata for enhanced alert
```

**Cache Management:**
- Max size: 10,000 flows
- Timeout: 60 seconds
- Automatic cleanup of old entries

## Performance Characteristics

### Throughput

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Events/sec | 1,000-5,000 | Depends on CPU |
| ML inference latency | 1-5ms per flow | With Random Forest |
| Feature extraction | <1ms per flow | Pure Python |
| Total per-flow overhead | 2-6ms | Acceptable for most networks |

### Resource Usage

| Component | CPU | Memory | Disk |
|-----------|-----|--------|------|
| Suricata (DPDK) | 200-400% | 2-4GB | Minimal |
| Kafka | 50-100% | 1-2GB | Variable |
| ML Consumer | 100-200% | 1-2GB | Minimal |
| **Total** | **350-700%** | **4-8GB** | **<100MB/hr logs** |

### Scalability

**Single Machine Limits:**
- ~10,000 flows/sec with Random Forest
- ~50,000 flows/sec with LightGBM
- Limited by CPU cores

**Scaling Options:**
1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple ML consumers with Kafka partitioning
2. **Batch Processing**: Process flows in batches for higher throughput
3. **GPU Acceleration**: Use TensorFlow/PyTorch models on GPU
4. **Flow Filtering**: Skip known benign services (e.g., NTP, DNS to trusted servers)

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Flow Filtering (Pre-ML)
Skip ML inference for known benign traffic:
```python
# Skip common benign services
if dest_port in [123, 53] and dest_ip in TRUSTED_SERVERS:
    return  # Skip ML
```

### 2. Batch Processing
Process multiple flows at once:
```python
# Instead of predict(single_flow)
predictions = model.predict_batch(flow_batch)  # 10-100 flows
```

### 3. Model Optimization
- Use LightGBM instead of Random Forest (10x faster)
- Quantize model weights (reduce precision)
- Prune decision trees (reduce depth)

### 4. Feature Selection
Reduce to most important features (65 → 20):
```python
# Use only top 20 features by importance
important_features = model.get_feature_importances()[:20]
```

### 5. Kafka Partitioning
Distribute flows across multiple consumers:
```
Kafka Topic (10 partitions)
    ↓
ML Consumer 1 (partitions 0-2)
ML Consumer 2 (partitions 3-5)
ML Consumer 3 (partitions 6-9)
```

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Flow Processing Rate**
   - Flows/sec processed
   - Lag (flows waiting in Kafka)

2. **ML Performance**
   - Inference latency (ms)
   - Predictions/sec
   - ML alerts generated

3. **Alert Quality**
   - False positive rate
   - True positive rate (if labeled data available)
   - Combined alerts (Suricata + ML)

4. **System Health**
   - CPU usage per component
   - Memory consumption
   - Kafka topic backlog

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# ML Consumer stats (printed every 30s)
tail -f logs/ml/ml_consumer.log

# Kafka lag
kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
    --describe --group ml-consumer-group

# System resources
htop
```

- Simple signature-based detection only
- Environments with no ML expertise for tuning
- Networks with extreme throughput (>1M flows/sec single machine)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Deep Learning Models**: CNN/RNN for packet payload analysis
2. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple ML models
3. **Online Learning**: Adapt model to network behavior in real-time
4. **Automated Tuning**: Auto-adjust thresholds based on false positive rate
5. **Distributed Processing**: Kubernetes deployment for massive scale
