# Virtual Environment Setup - COMPLETED ✓

## Date: October 2, 2025

## Problem Encountered
When attempting to install Python packages, encountered the "externally-managed-environment" error. This is a security feature in modern Ubuntu/Debian systems (24.04+) that prevents modification of system Python packages.

## Solution Implemented
Set up a Python virtual environment for the IDS project to isolate dependencies.

## Steps Completed

### 1. System Dependencies ✓
Installed required system packages:
- `python3.12-venv` - Virtual environment support
- `build-essential` - C/C++ compilation tools
- `pkg-config` - Package configuration management
- `python3-dev` - Python development headers
- `libnuma-dev` - NUMA library for DPDK
- `libpcap-dev` - Packet capture library
- Various other development libraries

### 2. Virtual Environment Creation ✓
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 3. Package Installation ✓
Successfully installed all packages from `requirements.txt`:
- **Core packages:** numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, psutil
- **Networking:** scapy, pyshark, kafka-python
- **ML/AI:** tensorflow (2.20.0), torch (2.8.0), keras
- **Development:** pytest, black, flake8, mypy
- **Monitoring:** prometheus-client, structlog

### 4. Helper Scripts Created ✓
- `activate_venv.sh` - Quick activation script
- `VENV_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### 5. Testing ✓
Verified all major packages can be imported successfully.

## Usage Going Forward

**Always activate the virtual environment before running Python scripts:**

```bash
# Option 1: Direct activation
source venv/bin/activate

# Option 2: Using helper script
source activate_venv.sh

# Then run your scripts
python src/basic_dpdk_test.py
python ml_enhanced_ids_pipeline.py
# etc.

# Deactivate when done
deactivate
```

## Files Added/Modified
- `venv/` - Virtual environment directory (in .gitignore)
- `activate_venv.sh` - Activation helper script
- `VENV_SETUP.md` - Setup documentation
- `VENV_SETUP_COMPLETED.md` - This summary

## Important Notes

1. **The virtual environment is local** - Each user needs to create their own
2. **Already in .gitignore** - Won't be committed to version control
3. **No system conflicts** - Project dependencies are isolated
4. **Easy to rebuild** - Just delete `venv/` and recreate if needed

## Verification Results

All major packages successfully imported:
- ✓ numpy
- ✓ pandas
- ✓ scapy
- ✓ tensorflow
- ✓ torch

Python version: 3.12.3
pip version: 25.2

## Next Steps

The environment is ready for use. You can now:
1. Run any Python scripts in the project
2. Install additional packages as needed (they'll go into the virtual environment)
3. Use Jupyter notebooks with this environment
